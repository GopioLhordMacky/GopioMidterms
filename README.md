## 1. What is React.js?

React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the view layer of web applications. With React, you can build fast, interactive, and dynamic web apps with ease. It was developed by Facebook and is now widely used across the web development community.

## 2. How to Set Up React.js

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to set up a new React.js project. Follow these steps to get your development environment ready and start building with React.


#### 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up a React.js project, make sure you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Youâ€™ll also need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer.

#### 2. Installing Node.js and npm

React.js requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies and run scripts.
   1. *Check if Node.js and npm are installed*
      Open a terminal and run the following commands:
      ```bash
      node -v
      npm -v
      ```
      If you see version numbers, you already have them installed.

   2. *Install Node.js and npm*
      If Node.js or npm is not installed, download the latest version from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

  
#### 3. Use `create-react-app`
   The `create-react-app` tool simplifies setting up a React project. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   Replace `my-app` with the name of your project folder.

#### 4. Navigate to the Project Directory
   After the setup is complete, go to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```
#### 5. Use `create-react-app`
   The `create-react-app` tool simplifies setting up a React project. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   Replace `my-app` with the name of your project folder.

#### 6. Navigate to the Project Directory
   After the setup is complete, go to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```
#### 7. Start the React App
   Start the development server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start the server and open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 8. Development Environment
   Now youâ€™re ready to start developing! Any changes you make in the `src` folder will automatically update in the browser, thanks to hot-reloading.
